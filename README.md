# WebAPI-JSP
Web application containing a database created in MySQL using JSP Technology for interface.

A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and electronically accessed from a computer system. 
If databases are more complex, they are often developed using formal design and modeling techniques.

In this project, I had to create a database containing "Poet" and "Books" tables,
the M:N association being made through the "Poetry Volumes" association table.
